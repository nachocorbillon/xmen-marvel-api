# Chris Claremont's X-Men - Marvel API

###### this is my own first ReactJS project

This project aims to provide reading orders for Claremont's X-Men comics. You can access the project by visiting [https://uncanny-xmen.netlify.app/](https://uncanny-xmen.netlify.app/). The Marvel API is used to retrieve detailed information about individual comics.
